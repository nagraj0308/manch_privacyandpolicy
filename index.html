        <p>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
        <p><u>Withdrawing your consent:</u> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express
        and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can
        withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section below.</p>
        <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
        applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful
        processing grounds other than consent.</p>
        <p><u>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</u> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional
        communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the
        details provided in the section below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still
        communicate with you â€” for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and
        use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>

    <div class="manchtextheading">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</div>
    <div class="manchtextm">
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or
        setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
        monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has
        been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
        the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

        information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all
        third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
        California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
        information provided below.</p>
        <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right
        to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please
        contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a
