                account with the
                relevant reward.

            anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
            been stored
            in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
            processing
            until deletion is possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="manchtextheading">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</div>
    <div class="manchtextm">
        <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical
            security
            measures.</p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to
            protect the
            security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
            information,
            no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
            secure, so
            we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be
            able to
            defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
            our best to
            protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your
            own risk.
            You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="manchtextheading">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</div>
    <div class="manchtextm">
        <p>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
        <p><u>Withdrawing your consent:</u> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
            which may be express
            and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
            time. You can
            withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
            below.</p>
        <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,
            when
            applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
            lawful
            processing grounds other than consent.</p>
        <p><u>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</u> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and
            promotional
            communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting
            us using the
            details provided in the section below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may
            still
            communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the
            administration and
            use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
        <div class="manchtextmb">Account Information</div>
        <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account,
            you can:
        <ul>
            <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
            <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from
            our active
            databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems,
            assist with any
            investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>

    <div class="manchtextheading">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</div>
    <div class="manchtextm">
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT')
            feature or
            setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
            activities
            monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT
            signals has
            been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically
            communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
            follow in
            the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
